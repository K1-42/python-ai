“Hirogaru Sky! "PreCure" is a TV anime produced by Toei Animation that was produced by Asahi Broadcasting Television and broadcast every Sunday from 8:30 to 9:00 on the TV Asahi network from February 5, 2023 to January 28, 2024. It is the 20th work in the "Pretty Cure" series,[3][4] and the 18th Precure.

The abbreviation is "Hiropuri" [5][Note 1]. The catchphrase is "To the expanding world! Hop! Step! Jump!"
overview

This work marks the 20th work in the series, and is officially positioned as a 20th anniversary work.[Note 2] Ten Washio of Toei Animation, who was the first producer of the series and is the executive producer of this work, expressed his gratitude, saying, ``I believe that I was able to continue this series for this long thanks to everyone's support.'' [4]

In this work, the motif is ``the sky,'' the theme is ``hero,'' and the keyword is ``the world that expands through knowledge.''[7] Regarding the sky, Washio said, ``The sky is endlessly expansive, a magnificent world that is endlessly blue and full of transparency. The protagonist of this work is a character who embodies the sky that everyone imagines,'' and regarding the ``hero,'' ABC Animation Producer Kou Tanaka said, ``The PreCure series is sometimes described as a ``transforming heroine.'' However, this time, we deliberately chose the theme of "hero". In the history of PreCure, which has evolved and expanded in various ways, what has remained unchanged is the image of these girls who have carved out a difficult path with their own hands and taken the lead and encouraged everyone. I chose this theme because I wanted to reconsider her appearance from a ``heroine'' to a ``hero,'' and added, ``I chose this theme as a culmination of this turning point year by portraying the hero figure that the PreCure series has created. We will deliver it to you," he said enthusiastically.[3][4]

Based on this concept, the main character of this work, Sora Harewatar (Cure Sky), is the first main character in the series to use blue as his image color instead of the pink that has been used so far [8], and even in the real world. The main character is a girl from another world, rather than a Japanese girl. In addition, Tsubasa Yunagi (Cure Wing) is the first regular character of a 12-year-old boy to become a male Pretty Cure [Note 3], and Seiageha (Cure Butterfly) is an 18-year-old adult female Pretty Cure [Note 4]. It is done [9].

Among the voice actors appearing, Ai Kakuma, who plays the role of Mashiro Nijigaoka (Cure Prism), played the healing animal Labyrin in the 2020 broadcast of "Healing Good PreCure", and will be re-cast as a regular member of PreCure in this work. It became. In addition, Kakuma said, ``All the time and experience I was involved in PreCure became my treasure,'' and based on the previous experience, ``I can't believe I will be able to participate in PreCure for another year...And this time... As a Precure...I keep thinking, ``Eh?? A dream???'', she commented happily.[10]

Like previous series works, this work also uses text broadcasting and data broadcasting. In the data broadcast, you can play the Sugoroku game ``Dice Roll! PreCure Collection ,'' where you roll the dice and collect all the PreCures from all the past works of the mass that stopped in an album. On the other hand, some of the content that was implemented in the previous two works is not implemented in this work (details will be described later) [11] [Note 5].

In addition, this work was broadcast all year round for the first time in four years since "Star Twinkle Precure", which was broadcast from February 2019 to January 2020, without any interruptions or shortening of the number of broadcast episodes or duration. Note 6].

In the final episode of this work, the main character of the next work will not appear in the main story, which has been done since ``Mahou Tsukai PreCure!'', and Cure Wonderful of the next work ``Wandaful PreCure!'' will only appear in the baton touch video [ep 1] .
story

Skyland is a world floating in the sky. That day was the birthday of the young princess of the kingdom, Elle, but Elle was taken advantage of by Kabaton, a monster from the Underg Empire, and was taken away. Sora Harewatar, a brave girl who aspires to be her hero, enters the warp space to save Elle, and before she knows it, she ends up in a completely different world, Solashid City.

Sora was confused by the fact that she had come to a completely different world with different culture and customs, but at that time she met a girl from Sorashid City, Mashiro Nijigaoka, and she lived with Elle, protecting Elle as a Pretty Cure and going to Skyland. She will fight to return to her home.
Character
Precure

Mashiro and Ageha are residents of ``Sorashido City,'' while Sora, Tsubasa, and Elle are from ``Skyland.'' In addition to Sora and El who have moved since the first episode, Ageha has also moved to the Nijigaoka family in Sorashid City since the 18th episode (see the section on St. Ageha for details). Tsubasa has been living with the Nijigaoka family for about a year.

As mentioned later, Sora and Mashiro are in the 2nd year class 2 of the middle school class of ``Private Sorashid Academy'' [Note 7], and Ageha is attending ``Sorashid Welfare Childcare College'' to become a nursery teacher, as described later.

In the first person, Sora, Mashiro, and Ageha are "me," Tsubasa is "me," and Elle is "elu" (Elle in girl form is "me").

According to Ten Washio, what the members have in common is that they are people who can act together, and that they are not portrayed as being in a leadership position just because they are boys or older.[15]

     The main character of this work. She is a girl from Skyland, a world in the sky. She transforms into the Precure of the sky, ``Cure Sky.'' Her hair and eyes are both blue, she has ahoge on the top of her head, and her right hair is tied up into a side tail.[Note 9] She is serious and polite, and speaks politely when interacting with people other than her family, but when it comes to people who would harm Elle, she uses a harsh tone, which is a contrast to her usual polite language. [ep 4] Her catchphrase is "It's the hero's turn!"
     At the beginning of the story, when he went from his hometown to the castle town to join the Blue Guards under the direct control of the Skyland royal family, he witnessed the princess Elle being kidnapped by Cabaton and fought to get Elle back. Inside, you will enter the warp space. She eventually arrives in Sorashido City, where she meets Mashiro, and her life changes, and she ends up living with the Nijigaoka family.
     She is extremely athletic and trains hard every day to become a hero like the person she admires (Sharala) who saved her when she was young. Because of this, she often gets invited to join her club activities [ep 6]. She is a user of Skyland Divine Fist and can split a huge rock in half with a single blow of her bare hands [ep 7]. However, since she was a child, she had spent every day devoted to training alone, so she had no friends until she met Mashiro, and at first, when she had a problem, she couldn't see her surroundings and often tried to solve it alone [ep 8 ]. As she and Mashiro deepen their bond through the PreCure battle, she learns the importance of cooperation.
     She was reunited with Sharala, the person she admired, when she returned to Skyland, and when she learned that Sharala had remembered her encounter with herself, she seemed moved. .
     After finishing the battle with the Anderg Empire, he returned to Skyland with Tsubasa and Elle, but occasionally visits the Nijigaoka family [ep 1].
     Prior to the start of the program, he also appeared as a guest in the C part of the January 29, 2023 broadcast (Episode 45) of the previous work in the series, "Delicious Party♡PreCure", with the first half appearing before the transformation and the second half appearing after the transformation. 17].

     She is a second year middle school girl who lives in Sorashid City. She transforms into the Pretty Cure of Light, ``Cure Prism.'' Her hair is long and dark red, with a section of her hair tied up at the back of her head. Her nickname is "Mashiron" [Note 10]. She is called ``Mashiro-san'' by Sora and Tsubasa, and ``supporting role'' by Kabaton. She is kind and considerate, and she is knowledgeable about things like cooking and nature. Since her parents are working overseas, she lives with her grandmother Yoyo. As will be explained later, since Yoyo is from Skyland, she also has some Skylander blood [ep 7]. She and Ageha are childhood friends, and she was shy when she was little [ep 9].
     She was living an ordinary life, but one day she suddenly became involved in a battle between Sora, who came from another world, and the Underg Empire [ep 10]. Later, Sora loses his Mirage Pen and is captured by Lamborg, making it impossible for him to transform.In his desire to help Sora, a Mirage Pen appears from his own body, and although he hesitates after receiving Kabaton's abuse, Ageha encourages him. She made up her mind and awakened to become a Precure [ep 11].
     In her daily life, even though she is swayed by Sora's tension, we can often see her side as a common sense person, such as calmly commenting on Sora's natural stupidity that she sometimes shows. On the other hand, she has a strong desire to help Sora as a PreCure, and she encourages Sora when he tries to deal with her problems alone, making her realize that she is an irreplaceable partner. I'm always aware of it.
Tsubasa Yuunagi / Cure Wing [19] [Note 11]

She is wearing brown shorts. Like Sora, she uses polite language towards her superiors. Basically, she is called ``Tsubasa-kun'' by those around her, and she is often called ``boy'' by those around her. She doesn't originally have a surname, but because she needs it when interacting with others, she uses the surname ``Yunagi'' for convenience, which she and Ageha came up with [ep 12 ].
     Her true identity is a race of birds living in Skyland called the Punibirds, and how she wandered into Sorashid City due to a distortion in space and time while practicing flying on a stormy day. have.
     She has a strong sense of responsibility, and after acquiring her PreCure abilities, she calls herself a "knight" who protects the princess, and always accompanies Elle.
     She enters Elle's room in the middle of the night to check on her, and Sora discovers her presence when she is talking to him.
     She feels disadvantaged by the fact that she cannot fly due to the nature of her race. However, after witnessing her own father fly once, she discovered her potential for flight, and even after coming to Solaseed City, she continued to teach herself aerodynamics. She continued to have a longing for the sky, including studying [ep 13].
     During a surprise attack from the sky by Kabaton using a UFO-type Lamborg, PreCure's abilities were awakened while fighting in a living state to protect El [ep 14]. Since then, she has been able to fly as a Precure, so she no longer reads books about flight, but the knowledge about the weather that she gained in the process was useful, and the things she learned will continue to spread in the future. This made me realize that, and I decided to work hard to acquire more knowledge [ep 15].

     bird form
         The original form of the Punibard tribe (see the Punibard tribe section for details). Its body color is orange, and it wears something like a red tie around its neck. In this form, she can communicate with other birds.
         It has appeared in various places such as on the arched gate and roof of the Nijigaoka house every time since the second episode, before its human form first appeared. It also appears in "time display by remote control operation" using the overlay display function in linked data broadcasting.

     When she was young, she lived near the Nijigaoka family and was close to Mashiro, but due to her mother's work, she moved to another city, but she still continues to pursue her goal of becoming the best nursery teacher, which has always been her goal. He had come to Sorashid City by car to attend a vocational school.[ep 11][ep 8]
     Her favorite car is a four-wheel drive car, which she calls ``Piyo-chan.''
     One day, she encountered Sora and Mashiro being attacked by Lamborg, and she saw them transform into PreCure, which led to her learning the secret of PreCure for the first time. She has since become a support role for Precure.
     She supports Mashiro, who was hesitant about becoming a Precure due to her own complexes [ep 11], and sees that Sora is hesitant to express her true feelings to Mashiro and cheers her up with makeup [ep 11]. 2] and has a caring personality. On the other hand, she is so eager for people that she sometimes stops relying on them, and she has been doing so ever since Sora and the others asked her to rely on them [ep 16 ]. She also doesn't like green peppers [ep 15].
     The nursery school they went to for nursery teacher training is attacked by Grasshopper Monder, and while Precure is also stopped by Lamborg, Grasshopper Monder says, ``The strongest nursery teacher and the hero all have the same goal: to protect the people they care about.'' When she confronts him, Mirage Pen appears and she awakens to PreCure. Later, when she joined the team as a PreCure, she thought it would be appropriate to work with Sora and the others, and moved to Sorashid City, where she ended up staying at the Nijigaoka family. 17].

     She is a young princess of Skyland. Her catchphrase is "Eruu~!", and since she was still young, she could only say "Pukyua~~!" at first, but gradually she started saying "Sora~!" You will be able to speak the language while doing so. According to Sora, she talks in her sleep by herself while she sleeps [ep 2]. Since her real name is unknown, her name ``Elle'' was named by Sora for convenience based on her voice, but it turns out to be her real name [ep 7]. She transforms into PreCure and has the mysterious power to create "Sky Tone" which gives PreCure new powers.
     She comes to Sorashid City with Sora after being kidnapped by Kabaton.
     When he went out, he was initially carried by Sora and Mashiro in the sling that Yoyo gave him, but when he saw Sky being overwhelmed by Lamborg's attack, he became worried, so the sling changed to a rainbow-colored boat-shaped one. After that, he was able to move freely [ep 7][ep 8].
     In reality, she is the ``child of destiny'' entrusted to the king and queen by Ichibanboshi, who has the power to save Skyland. The couple who entrusted the child to him have raised him like their own for the future, even though he is not their biological child. A purple light similar to the first star appeared from El's chest, and since she had grown up with Sora and his friends, the couple entrusted Sora and his friends to protect and raise El. 18]. It was later revealed that her true identity was an existence equivalent to Elrein's alter ego (or reincarnation) created by Ichibanboshi [ep 19].
     Due to Skiahead's strategy, she was kidnapped by the Underg Empire and held captive by Kaiserin, but when she saw the PreCures fighting hard and prayed, she escaped from the empire and at the same time changed into a girl and became Cure Majesty. Fight by changing [ep 20]. When Sora and the others, who do not know the details of the incident, have doubts about her true identity, she reveals that she has transformed into Majesty herself, and Sora and the others believed it because of its authenticity, but when the important transformation was not possible, Sora and the others agreed. I began to explore [ep 21]. She saw Precure fighting against Minoton, who had become ferocious after being poured with Underg Energy, and jumped into the battle with the thought of ``I want to protect everyone I love,'' and as if in response, a Mirage Pen appeared. Fulfilling her transformation [ep 21].
     On the night of Thrikmas, she reunited with Elrein, who had become the first star, and by receiving her power, she grew into a girl, and even as a Pretty Cure, she inherited the power of Cure Noble. Now you can use her powerful powers. However, when she gets hungry, she returns to her original infant form [ep 19].
     Prior to the start of the program, she also appeared as a guest in the C part of the previous series "Delicious Party PreCure" broadcast on January 29, 2023 (Episode 45), just like Sora.[Note 13] .
